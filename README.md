# About the projects that I uploaded on GitHub

# I'm uploading code in Java for small projects that I have worked on, be it in college courses or in my spare time.
# I need somewhere to save them just in case my computer fails.
# There isn't much here, but I'll continue to add more over time.

git init
git add MyArrayList.java
