# Hi
# Welcome to my website

On one hand, I'm uploading code in Java for small projects that I have worked on here, be it in college courses or in my spare time.
I need somewhere to save them just in case my computer fails.

On another hand, I want to put other things here, such as a portfolio.
There isn't much here, but I'll continue to add more over time.

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://capperj123.github.io
git puch -u origin main
