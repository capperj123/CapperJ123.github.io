# Hi
# Welcome to my website

I’m making this website for a couple reasons:

1) I'm uploading code in Java for small projects that I have worked on, be it in college courses or in my spare time.
So I needed somewhere to save them just in case my computer fails.

2) I can post links to socials or other sites that I work on.

3) On another hand, I want to put other things here, such as a portfolio.
   
There isn't much here, but I'll continue to add more over time.
